# docker-openresty - Docker tooling for OpenResty

[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/openresty/docker-openresty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openresty/docker-openresty)  [![Appveyor status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/openresty/docker-openresty?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/openresty/docker-openresty)  [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/openresty/openresty.svg)](https://microbadger.com/#/images/openresty/openresty "microbadger.com")

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

The following "flavors" are available and built from [upstream OpenResty packages](http://openresty.org/en/linux-packages.html):

- [`centos`, `centos-rpm`, (*centos/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/centos/Dockerfile)
- [`stretch`, (*stretch/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/stretch/Dockerfile)
- [`stretch-fat`, (*stretch/Dockerfile.fat*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/stretch/Dockerfile.fat)
- [`windows`, (*windows/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/windows/Dockerfile)

The following "flavors" are built from source and are intended for more advanced and custom usage, caveat emptor:

- [`alpine`, (*alpine/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile)
- [`alpine-fat`, (*alpine/Dockerfile.fat*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile.fat)
- [`bionic`, (*bionic/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/bionic/Dockerfile)
- [`xenial`, (*xenial/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/xenial/Dockerfile)

Starting with `1.13.6.1`, releases are tagged with `<openresty-version>-<image-version>-<flavor>`.  The latest `image-version` will also be tagged `<openresty-version>-<flavor>`.   The HEAD of the master branch is also labeled plainly as `<flavor>`.  The builds are managed by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/openresty/docker-openresty) and [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/openresty/docker-openresty) (for Windows images).

It is *highly recommended* that you use the upstream-based images for best support.  For best stability, pin your images to the full tag, for example `1.13.6.2-0-xenial`.

Description
===========

`docker-openresty` is [Docker](https://www.docker.com) tooling for OpenResty (https://www.openresty.org).

Docker is a container management platform.

OpenResty is a full-fledged web application server by bundling the standard nginx core,
lots of 3rd-party nginx modules, as well as most of their external dependencies.

From non-RPM/DEB flavors, the following modules are included by default, but one can easily increase or decrease that with [custom build options](#build-options) :

 * file-aio
 * http_addition_module
 * http_auth_request_module
 * http_dav_module
 * http_flv_module
 * http_geoip_module=dynamic
 * http_gunzip_module
 * http_gzip_static_module
 * http_image_filter_module=dynamic
 * http_mp4_module
 * http_random_index_module
 * http_realip_module
 * http_secure_link_module
 * http_slice_module
 * http_ssl_module
 * http_stub_status_module
 * http_sub_module
 * http_v2_module
 * http_xslt_module=dynamic
 * ipv6
 * mail
 * mail_ssl_module
 * md5-asm
 * pcre-jit
 * sha1-asm
 * stream
 * stream_ssl_module
 * threads


Usage
=====

If you are happy with the build defaults, then you can use the openresty image from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openresty/openresty/).  The image tags available there are listed at the top of this README.

```
docker run [options] openresty/openresty:stretch-fat
```

*[options]* would be things like -p to map ports, -v to map volumes, and -d to daemonize.

`docker-openresty` symlinks `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/logs/access.log` and `error.log` to `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr` respectively, so that Docker logging works correctly.  If you change the log paths in your `nginx.conf`, you should symlink those paths as well. This is not possible with the `windows` image.

nginx config files
==================

The Docker tooling installs its own [`nginx.conf` file](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/nginx.conf).  If you want to directly override it, you can replace it in your own Dockerfile or via volume bind-mounting.

For the Linux images, that `nginx.conf` has the directive `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` so all nginx configurations in that directory will be included.  The [default virtual host configuration](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/nginx.vh.default.conf) has the original OpenResty configuration and is copied to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`. 

You can override that `default.conf` directly or volume bind-mount the `/etc/nginx/conf.d` directory to your own set of configurations:

```
docker run -v /my/custom/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d openresty/openresty:alpine
```

When using the `windows` image you can change the main configuration directly:
```
docker run -v C:/my/custom/nginx.conf:C:/openresty/conf/nginx.conf openresty/openresty:windows
```

OPM
===

Starting at version 1.11.2.2, OpenResty for Linux includes a [package manager called `opm`](https://github.com/openresty/opm#readme), which can be found at `/usr/local/openresty/bin/opm`.

`opm` is built in all the images except `alpine` and `stretch`.

To use `opm` in the `alpine` image, you must also install the `curl` and `perl` packages; they are not included by default because they double the image size.  You may install them like so: `apk add --no-cache curl perl`.

To use `opm` within the `stretch` image, you can either use the `stretch-fat` image or install the `openresty-opm` package in a custom build (which you would need to do to install your own `opm` packages anyway), as shown in [this example](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/stretch/Dockerfile.opm_example).


LuaRocks
========

[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) is included in the `alpine-fat`, `centos`, and `xenial` variants.  It is excluded from `alpine` because it generally requires a build system and we want to keep that variant lean.

It is available at `/usr/local/openresty/luajit/bin/luarocks`.  Packages can be added in your dependent Dockerfiles like so:

```
RUN /usr/local/openresty/luajit/bin/luarocks install <rock>
```


Tips & Pitfalls
===============

 * The `envsubst` utility is included in all images except `alpine` and `windows`; this utility is also included
 in the Nginx docker image and is used to template environment variables into configuration files.

 * **Docker Hub** does not currently support ARM builds, thus an `armhf-xenial` image is not available (See [#26](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/pull/26)). You can build an image yourself using the `RESTY_DEBIAN_BASE` build argument:
 ```
docker build -f xenial/Dockerfile --build-arg "RESTY_DEBIAN_BASE=armv7/armhf-ubuntu" .
```

 * By default, OpenResty is built with SSE4.2 optimizations if the build machine supports it.  If run on machine without SSE4.2, there will be [invalid opcode issues](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/issues/39). **Thus all the Docker Hub images require SSE4.2.**  You can [build a custom image from source](#building-from-source) explicitly without SSE4.2 support, using build arguments like so:
```
docker build -f xenial/Dockerfile --build-arg "RESTY_CONFIG_OPTIONS_MORE=--with-luajit-xcflags='-mno-sse4.2'" .
```

* All of the image flavors use `OpenSSL 1.1.0h`.  Be careful of compatibility between
  your `opm` and LuaRocks packages -- they must all use the same OpenSSL version.

* The `1.13.6.2-alpine` is built from `OpenSSL 1.0.2.k` because of build issues on Alpine.

Docker CMD
==========

The `-g "daemon off;"` directive is used in the Dockerfile CMD to keep the Nginx daemon running after container creation. If this directive is added to the nginx.conf, then the `docker run` should explicitly invoke `openresty` (or `nginx` for `windows` images):
```
docker run [options] openresty/openresty:xenial openresty
```

Invoke another CMD, for example the `resty` utility, like so:
```
docker run [options] openresty/openresty:xenial resty [script.lua]
```

*NOTE* The `alpine` images do not include the packages `perl` and `ncurses`, which is needed by the `resty` utility.


Building (from source)
======================

This Docker image can be built and customized by cloning the repo and running `docker build` with the desired Dockerfile:

```
git clone https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty.git
cd docker-openresty
docker build -t myopenresty -f xenial/Dockerfile .
docker run myopenresty
```

Dockerfiles are provided for the following base systems, selecting the Dockerfile path with `-f`:

 * [Alpine](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile) (`alpine/Dockerfile`)
 * [Alpine Fat](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/alpine-fat/Dockerfile) (`alpine-fat/Dockerfile`)
 * [Ubuntu Xenial](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/xenial/Dockerfile) (`xenial/Dockerfile`)

We used to support more build flavors but have trimmed that down.  Older Dockerfiles are archived in the [`archive`](https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/tree/master/archive) folder.


The following are the available build-time options. They can be set using the `--build-arg` CLI argument, like so:

```
docker build --build-arg RESTY_J=4 -f xenial/Dockerfile .
